Hi! I am Sorasi, I am a self-taught Full Stack Web Developer.
I used to work in Finance industry as a Front Office Application Support.
I spent the past months learning modern Javascript development especially on the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node.js), and building my own web applications.

Today, I want my new passion for Web Development to be a new path in my professional career.

I use this website to present myself, provide a link to download my resume and accesses to my main projects.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
